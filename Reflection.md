Reflection: Balancing Stakeholder Needs
Challenge 1: Patient Data Privacy vs. Accessibility
Issue: Patients want easy access to their medical history, but regulations require strict data protection.
Solution: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Challenge 2: Flexible Scheduling vs. Hospital Resource Optimization
Issue: Doctors prefer flexible scheduling, but hospitals need optimized resource usage.
Solution: AI-based scheduling to suggest alternative slots while maximizing hospital efficiency.
Challenge 3: System Downtime vs. Frequent Updates
Issue: IT staff require minimal downtime, but frequent system updates are necessary.
Solution: Use blue-green deployment to roll out updates without disrupting services.
