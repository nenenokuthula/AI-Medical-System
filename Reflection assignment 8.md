Challenges Faced:
Granularity of States & Actions:

Finding the right level of detail for state transitions was tricky. Too many states made diagrams complex, while too few made them less useful.

Example: Should "Appointment Requested" and "Appointment Pending" be separate states?

Aligning with Agile User Stories:

Ensuring diagrams reflected real user stories required adjustments.

Example: The Payment Processing workflow had to match real-world payment gateway behavior.

Comparison of State vs. Activity Diagrams:
State Transition Diagrams focus on object lifecycle changes. Example: Appointment moving from Requested to Scheduled.

Activity Diagrams model step-by-step processes. Example: How an appointment is booked, including decisions and parallel tasks.
