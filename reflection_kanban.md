## **Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template**  
- **Choosing the right template** → *Automated Kanban* was the best fit, but additional columns like *Testing* and *Blocked* were needed.  
- **Managing dependencies** → Some tasks (e.g., AI scheduling) depend on others, requiring a *Blocked* column.  

## **Comparison: GitHub Projects vs. Trello vs. Jira**  

| Tool              | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **GitHub Projects** | Integrated with codebase, supports automation | Less flexible than Jira for advanced workflows |
| **Trello** | Simple, intuitive UI, drag-and-drop | Lacks built-in automation and GitHub integration |
| **Jira** | Powerful for Agile planning, supports backlog grooming | Can be complex for smaller teams |

## **Lessons Learned**  
- **Automation saves time** when managing medical appointment features.  
- **GitHub Projects is effective for Agile teams** when integrated with Issues.  
- **Kanban helps visualize bottlenecks**, especially in AI scheduling tasks.
