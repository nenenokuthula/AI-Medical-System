# SmartMed - AI-Powered Medical Appointment System

## Description
SmartMed is an intelligent medical appointment system that allows patients to book consultations, doctors to manage schedules, and hospitals to optimize resource allocation. It features automated scheduling, real-time notifications, and integration with electronic health records (EHR).

Assignment 8
Task 3: Integration with Prior Work
Traceability
In this task, we are required to map the object state transition diagrams and activity workflow diagrams to the following elements from the previous assignments:

Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):

Mapping to Functional Requirements (FRs): The state transition diagrams and activity diagrams should directly address specific functional requirements identified in Assignment 4. For instance, in the case of the Patient Object, the state transitions between Registered, In Consultation, and Completed directly support FR-001, which states that the system must allow patients to book, attend, and complete consultations.

For each state transition or workflow, we should provide a reference to the functional requirement that it supports. For example:

Patient Registration Workflow: The workflow of registering a patient (from the "New" state to "Registered") directly supports FR-002, which specifies the registration process for patients.

Appointment Booking Workflow: This maps to FR-003, which ensures that patients can successfully book an appointment based on doctor availability.

User Stories and Sprint Tasks (Assignment 6):

Mapping to User Stories: Each workflow and state transition must be linked to specific user stories from Assignment 6. For example, a user story like "As a patient, I want to view available doctors so that I can book an appointment" should be reflected in the Doctor Availability Management Workflow.

Sprint Task Mapping: Each diagram must also tie to a specific sprint task. For example, the "Cancel Appointment" workflow might have been planned as a sprint task, aligning with the sprint planning process.
